# Here’s What We’ve Been Up To

Despite variable blog posts, DCS has gone on! We recently completed a project in which we (the programmers) collaborated with musical groups and composers as well as a dancer to create a dance performance that integrates our CPX as well as the other group’s dance and musical components. Here I’ll show you some of the things that I’ve learned.

[Here](https://makecode.com/_8qY23jKk49Fx) I have a simple code aimed at changing colors when the “roll” of the CPX changes. This same code can be used with “pitch” as well but this one in-particular specifies in only controlling the lights as the CPX “rolls” left and right on its axis. At the start I set all of my pixels to white just to signal that the CPX is on and the code is running. I then used the “on tilt right” and “on tilt left” inputs to change the colors. When my CPX tilts right the pixels turn blue and when it tilts left it turns yellow.

My next code is a timer that I originally stole from the tutorials on makecode but have become proficient in making myself. The timer sets a proton to move forward one pixel on the CPX whenever the A button is pressed. On a “loud sound” the photon flips directions and begins counting down. At the end, flashy lights go off.

You can watch how I make this  [basic timer](https://www.useloom.com/share/185aa3763df74d5093debf706922042d) on makecode through this link.

Since I originally made the timer [I have added](https://makecode.com/_1t4ED5hXtKX2)  a function to clear all previous animations, created a song, made a tune play on the start, changed the brightness of some of the lights and changed the pixel color at the beginning.
