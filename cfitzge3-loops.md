**Loops in Python**

1\.  **For Loops** iterate over a given sequence. The code below will print x for 6 iterations.

2\. **While Loops** repeat as long as the condition is met. The code below prints x while it is less than ten, and then adds one before repeating. This code prints every integer up to 10 starting with 0.

3\. **Else.** The code below prints x while x is less than ten. Once the condition x<10 is no longer met, it prints y.
