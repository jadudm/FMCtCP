# Using the Accelerometer in MakeCode
For my code, there are two levels. One level is a basic light sensor, that was 
used in our dance performance. For this, the light sensor will detect when the light 
level is less than 5, meaning that once the sensor is subject to a specific amount of 
darkness, then the LEDs on the CPx will light up in white.

## Second Piece of the Puzzle
For the second part of my code, I have initialized the accelerometer to use the x axis 
of the CPx’s orientation. I have also set the limit for the accelerometer on the x axis 
to 1023, which means that for each movement along the x axis, the CPx will illuminate 
an LED in a different color along the rainbow spectrum up to the color that sits at 
the value of 1023. The last part of the code is the console log value, which basically 
will associate all values of the x axis to the sensor reading, which will allow the CPx 
to interpret the meanings of the accelerometer, thus translating the readings into the 
colors seen on the CPx. This means that with the light level, the above code will only 
initialize when the light sensors detect darkness.

## Third Piece of the Puzzle
For the third part of my code, I have replaced the general ‘while’ statement 
with an ‘if, else’ statement, which uses the light level specifications as the if 
statement, causing the accelerometer code to initiate when the light level is 
less than 5. If the light level is greater than 5, then the code states that the 
pixels on the CPx will illuminate red.
