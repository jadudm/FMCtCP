## Simple Program

For my simple program I wrote a program that turns on a red light when the sound level hits 155. That means it is a statement, that when the sound level is 155, it reads as true. Therefore when the sound level hits 155, the statement is read as false and the lights show the color red. The Boolean has functions of both true and false and when the sound level hits 155 the true statement is acted upon in the program and the red light turns on. When it is not true it goes to the else or false statement which means that the pixels are no longer red.

## Slightly more Complex Program

For the slightly more complex program I brought in another color light, instead of the pixels only turning red they also change blue. So when the sound level hits 155 in this program, the lights still show the color red. The true statement still corresponds to the red light. Now when the sound level is not at 155, the statement reads as false and therefore it shows blue light. This time instead of there being no command in the false statement it now shows blue light.

## More Complex or Different Program

For the do it differently program, I wanted the CPX to also display the blue and red lights. This time I used the Boolean Function or true and false statements differently. In spirit of doing it differently I decided to use the button on the CPX to be the “true” statement, therefore when button A is pressed the lights turn red, because the button being pressed is “true”. When button A is not pressed the lights are blue. This is because when the button is not pressed it is read as false, and in this case the false is when the blue lights are shown.
