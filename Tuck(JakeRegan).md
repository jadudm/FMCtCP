The first program I created was as simple as it gets. Due to my lack of experience I have in coding, the very basics was a good place to start. Instead of printing the standard “Hello world,” I chose the words “Howdy Folks!” to have my Python code print. Using the keyword work ‘Print,’ I was able to show the words in the console. This is a basic understanding of a keyword (which is the color blue) and how with punctuation that word can deliver a message to the console in the language of Python.

Following this, I branched out into a few other commands and keywords, which were problem and didn’t work very well. Using some loops I tried to use the but I got frustrated, and was unable to figure all of the details out, so I switched to Make-code.

I decided to make a code that played twinkle twinkle when bottom A was pressed. I ran into a few difficulties int he code, one being that I found that I needed pauses in between the note in order for them to read each not individually. I surmised that the computer read the notes too fast so pausing it for half a second let each tone play. Oh, and the lights are constantly blue throughout!

That’s all I wrote for this project- exploring python was interesting and I learned more about the tones in Make-code. Thank You!
