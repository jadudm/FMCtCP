Loom Part 2
Making a second loom video proved to be much easier than the first. It started with a program which built of a similar idea that I used last. Lately in my explorations of MadeCode and the CPx, I’ve been playing with the notes and how long they last with different pauses put in between them. The idea of musical timing was simultaneously running in my head while I wrote the program. In addition to the timing of the music, the timing of the lights was a factor I talked about in my last video, but was not able to figure the coding out for that particular song. However, using similar pause times I discover it is really easy to have music and lighting sounds and signals line up.

The majority of my time was spent sounding out the National Anthem to find which notes went where. The mini piano that MakeCode has helped visualize the distance between notes, making the process easier. Once I’d assembled a bit of the song, I began to play around with the lights. Once I figured out what my light scheme would be, I created a similarly formatted program as the music, hoping but not knowing whether the timing would work. Luckily the run-time for an individual sound and for a light sequence are the same! This was a relieving discovery which made the rest of my program quite easy to coordinate.

Here it the code in MadeCode for this current project!
