# Learning about Loops and Repetitions

This chapter is intended to highlight the difference between forever loops and repeat blocks in make-code. Eventually, you might find yourself in a situation where one loop is better than the other. In this demonstration, you will see how one cat make both make-code blocks do, essentially, the same thing.

The  **first program** simply plays a “Middle C” tone for 2 beats at the start and that is it. It is a very simple program, but there is more going on behind the blocks. Like I showed in my last chapter, the blocks, beats, and tones only mean something to the CPX because the programmers of make-code previously defined these functions and variables.

The  **second program** plays a set of tones separated by pauses in a forever loop. The first tone is a middle C for 2 beats, then a high B for 2 beats, and finally a low C for 4 beats. Once the third tone is done playing it starts with the first one again. This explores how make code uses forever loops and also how order matters.

The  **third program** aims to do the same as the second program. At the start it plays the same 3 tones and then repeats them so many times that it approximates the forever loop. This explores the different kinds of loops and how they contrast and compare to each other.
