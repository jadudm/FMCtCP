# Lateness is Greatness: Midnight Runs with Code

So today I programmed a couple of things. I’ll take you through a few, pretty monotonous codes that I’ve done in the past day or so and describe my vision of how I can use them later. My first code involves the CPX and its use of sound and the second two are from the website trinket in which I draw two different types of Bates Bs.

The sound code I did for the CPX in make code is pretty easy. I take a “while true” loop and say that when the sound level reaches above a certain threshold, proceed with the command inside of that function. Inside the function I show a ring of blue lights , followed by a pause, then a light ring of blue lights, and then finally and increase in brightness. Now, when a loud sound is heard the CPX should light up in bright blue lights!

My next code is on a website called trinket which I’ve been messing around with recently. In this code I make a turtle which will serve as my drawing tool. I set the color to red… because why not. I use codes to draw circles and semicircles and other straight lines off of position I set. in the end I turn out with an outline of a fairly good looking Bates B.

My [final code](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/185952ddc1) was the most complex. It was similar to the outline of the first Bates B but I take it and make thicker pens, different colors, start and end to fillings, a second turtle and different speeds. Although unsuccessful, I tried to use a position function to start a second turtle at the same position as my first turtle at a specific time. This could be useful in different ways of using the CPX. In the end, I turn out with an even better looking Bates B while using many more lines and ideas.
