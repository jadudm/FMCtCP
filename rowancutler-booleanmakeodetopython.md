# **Prototype 2: this time we try the booleans**
The first time I tried to explore the boolean future on makecode it left me more confused than ever (if you like memes and funny vines I advise you to look at my first post on this) but I have gone to the TA's for help and feel slightly more confident.  So now we try again...

I started by first exploring what options there were to explore within the Boolean section of makecode. I decided to experiment with the forever block so I could see the change in the boolean functions. I experimented with the if-then blocks and then switched some of the functions around. I decided to play around with what to put in the first boolean option and in the end, decided on if the button A is pressed do the animation shown in the picture below and if not do a different animation. It took some time to figure this all out and just some playing around but in the end, I am proud of my final project. Despite the "BOO" in boolean it's really not that scary.![Screen Shot 2018-04-13 at 10.58.54 PM.png](https://rowannyourboat.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-13-at-10-58-54-pm.png)

I also experimented with putting this into mu to convert it into python. This was a bit tricky and I went to a TA for help as I still am not 100 percent on python but am definitely more confident in it now. Everything is explained in the video:
